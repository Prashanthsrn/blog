This project is a 2D top-down RPG-style game built using Unity. The goal of this game is to escape an AI enemy while collecting coins. The AI enemy predicts the player's next moves using its previous moves and not just following the player's current position. 
*Implementation*
  - The game is built in a Unity 2D environment. It involves a player, an enemy, and coins the player can collect.  Each component has an animation: the player and enemy have walking animations, and the coin has a rotating animation.
  - The enemy predicts the player's movement by storing the player's previous moves and calculating the average for the next move.
