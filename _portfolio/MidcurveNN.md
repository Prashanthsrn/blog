title: "MidcurveNN"
excerpt: "A research project that is exploring computation of midcurves from 2D closed polygon shapes"
collection: portfolio
---

I worked on enhancing the PhD thesis under Dr. Yogesh Kulkarni. 
Midcurve computation has been implemented in 3 ways: 
-  Using a simple encoder decoder
-  Using dense encoder decoder 
-  Using CNN-based encoder decoder
