This is an Open3D-based point cloud visualization tool. I developed this to test out a 2d image to point cloud generation project I worked on

*Implementation*
  - Uses Open3D library to handle point cloud data loading and normal estimation
  - Uses Matplotlib for 3D visualization with interactive camera controls
  - Used the Stanford bunny model as the example ply model
