A Halide-based implementation of Histogram equalization, which is an image processing technique that improves the contrast. This project uses halide optimization capabilities to efficiently process images on the CPU using parallelization and vectorization.

*Implementation*
  - Uses Open3D library to handle point cloud data loading and normal estimation
  - Uses Matplotlib for 3D visualization with interactive camera controls
  - Used the Stanford bunny model as the example ply model
