I am a Computer Science graduate from the BITS-Pilani with a strong interest in Computer Vision, 3D model generation, and AI. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a deep passion for understanding how AI can enhance virtual experiences, especially through 3D perception and reconstruction. 

I am passionate about building smart, adaptive systems that push the boundaries of immersive experiences. With experience in diffusion models, reinforcement learning, and computer vision, Iâ€™m currently exploring how AI can reshape virtual interactions.

My background includes working as a software engineer at Zynga, where I developed solutions that enhanced gameplay experiences. Today, Iâ€™m diving deeper into AI-driven 3D perception, working on projects that merge creativity and technology.

Whether Iâ€™m working on diffusion models or experimenting with generative AI systems, my goal is to push the limits of whatâ€™s possible in the world of immersive technology. In my free time, I enjoy painting, running, and tennis!
