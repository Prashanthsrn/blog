Midcurve computation: the dimension reduction of 2D thin polygon shapes to 1D curves is important for several Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) applications. This paper advances the state-of-the-art neural network-based Midcurve computation by building on the previous work in MidcurveNN. This paper introduces two neural network-based architectures for computing Midcurves: a dense neural network architecture and a CNN-based architecture. We explore the effectiveness of modern deep-learning techniques. While dense networks show limited improvement, CNN-based models with skip connections reduced average loss by a factor of 10.
